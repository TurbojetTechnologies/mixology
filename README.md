**Mixology project**

Mixology is a Drupal 8 distribution that is preconfigured to use
the _Mixology Components_ module and _Mixtheme_ theme, which
are built with sass using the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) 
and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) libraries
for styling.

**Developer Info**

By default, the sass code expects the bourbon and neat
libraries to be installed in `[drupal root]/libraries/sass`.

If you are merely installing this distribution and are not
updating the code, you do not need to install bourbon or
neat.
